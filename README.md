A template for web dev using Grunt.js, Handlebars &amp; LESS

To get started:

        cd /location/of/repo/
        npm install

You'll need to have node, npm (which should come with node), grunt & the grunt-cli installed as well

        apt-get install nodejs
        npm install grunt
        npm install grunt-cli
        
Alternatively, you could install grunt & the grunt-cli globally for easier re-use in future projects

        npm install -g grunt
